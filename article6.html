        <h2>Gian Suspected to be a K-Pop Stan?</h2>
        <p class="article">After a lot of back and forth between Gian and his best friend they finally came to a conclusion. Gian is officially a ONCE(Twice’s fandom name). This is due to a K-pop themed event that occurred in Calgary, then soon following that he was spotted at the Twice: Ready to be Concert in downtown Toronto. There he was spotted dancing to Twice’s song “The Feels” along with other fans in a random K-pop dance event too. Other fandoms that Gian is suspected to be in are as follows:</p>
        <div class="article-p2">
            <li>ARMY (BTS)</li>
            <li>BLINK (Blackpink)</li>
            <li>ONCE (Twice)</li>
            <li>ReVeluv (Red Velvet)</li>
            <li>Bunnies (NewJeans)</li>
            <li>ATINY (ATEEZ)</li>
            <li>STAY (Stray Kids)</li>
            <li>FearNots (Lessarafim)</li>
            <li>Neverland (G)I-DLE</li>
        </div>
        <p class="article-p2">He was spotted taking K-pop dance classes in Calgary according to one of his close friends, Julius. This is strange as Gian has not taken up dance since he was in the seventh grade. So what could this mean for his character development arch of 2023?</p>
        <p class="article-p2">Gian has yet to confirm or deny these allegations, but we will keep you updated as the story develops.</p>
