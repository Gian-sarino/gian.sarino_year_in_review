        <h2>New Characters!</h2>
        <p class="article">Mega star Gian Sarino was spotted around a new friend group in downtown Calgary, and Lethbridge. After the scandal that happened regarding his ex-girlfriend, Gian had to go on a 3 month long hiatus cutting off most of his friends and family. Later after news of the scandal had only been allegations, he was spotted in the downtown metropolitan area of Calgary with a new group of friends, calling themselves the “Hype Boys, and Girls.” The new crew bonds over K-pop, lavish parties, dancing and delicious food.
