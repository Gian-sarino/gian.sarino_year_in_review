        <h2>How this star lost 50lbs??</h2>
        <p class="article">Weight loss is something everyone aspires to achieve at some point in their life. For Gian, that was especially true. Photo A was taken at the end of 2022 and the most recent one was taken last weekend.However,  progress is not alway a straight path. Like all things it takes time, dedication and an unholy amount of pre workout. In an exclusive interview we asked Gian about what it took to make this dramatic change in his life.</p> 

        <p class="article-p2">“What motivated you to go to the gym everyday?”</p>
        
        <p class="article-p2">Gian:  Honestly, a lot of it was because of A.& D. but most importantly I just focused on keeping myself disciplined, and kept outside distractions to a minimum in order to focus on reaching my goals.</p>
