        <h2>Gian Spotted in Tokyo!</h2>
        <p class="article">Mega Star Gian Sarino was spotted traveling the world! This time, in Tokyo. He was spotted in Akihabara buying manga, and drinking matcha lattes with his family. Some sources even saw him riding around in go karts in Shibuya. His photography is going international as he made it onto multiple magazines featuring street photography. This has even connected him with some clients in other parts of Asia such as Korea and Thailand. One day Gian hopes to return to japan to work as an Artist but for now he will stick to his roots in Canada and grow his reputation.
