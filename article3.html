        <h2>Character Development!</h2>
        <p class="article">After the scandal in March, Gian has dedicated all his time and energy to himself, devoting more time to the gym and his mental well-being. A lot has changed in the young star's personality since then. In his words, “the single life has been treating me good.” Soon after he commented that he proceeded to sing “Talking to the moon” by Bruno Mars alone in his car at 2 am. This Year Gian has gone through lots of ups and downs, and has made tremendous progress thus far, and we are excited to see what is next to come.</p>
